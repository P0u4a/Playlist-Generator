# How to run locally

## Installation
Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/P0u4a/youtube-music-playlist-wizard.git``` 

Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies
## Oauth Credentials
Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started and enable
the Youtube data api v3

Configure your Oauth consent screen, making sure to set the scope
to ```https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl```

Under the credentials tab, click new credentials and choose **new
Oauth client ID**. Choose web app as the application type and set the
**Authorised Javascript Origins** to ```http://localhost:3000```
(assuming you are hosting on port 3000, otherwise set your own port).
Then, set the **Authorised redirect URI** to ```http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google```.
## Enviornment Variables
Inside the app's root directory, create a ```.env``` file and add the following variables:
 * ```CLIENT_ID```
 * ```CLIENT_SECRET```
 * ```NEXTAUTH_SECRET```

Set ```CLIENT_ID``` and ```CLIENT_SECRET``` to the values generated when you created your
Oauth credentials. Lastly, you should set ```NEXTAUTH_SECRET``` to a randomly generated value as it 
is used to encyrpt the JSON web tokens generated during the Oauth flow.
## Running the app
Run ```npm run dev``` in the terminal and make the magic happen.

# Future Extensions ðŸ”®
* Implement bot account to create playlists on if user does not want to sign in
